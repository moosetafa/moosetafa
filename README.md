- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mustafa 
Iâ€™m a computer science student currently in college interested in learning about new technologies and implementing them in interesting ways to solve problems. I am currently learning about many languages such as c++
and python and plan to use my skills to collaborate on anything that would help me learn more about those languages and the development process overall. I can be reached 
at this email for any inquiries.
